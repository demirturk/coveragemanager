# coveragemanager
This study proposes a framework that optimizes the energy--security--coverage trade-off by enabling adaptive security and sustained network coverage in WSNs composed of Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR)-enabled FPGA sensor nodes for Internet of Things (IoT) applications

The simulation can be started by running the main.m script. This script generates coverage-optimization results for scenarios with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) enabled and disabled.
SIM_INPUT.m script includes simulation paramaters such as number of nodes, max energy budget and round number of the simulation.
neo_call_energy_info.m script includes real DPR and encryption operation energy consumption values
