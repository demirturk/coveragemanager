# coveragemanager
This study proposes a framework that optimizes the energy--security--coverage trade-off by enabling adaptive security and sustained network coverage in WSNs composed of Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR)-enabled FPGA sensor nodes for Internet of Things (IoT) applications

This repository contains a MATLAB simulation framework for coverage optimisation in an energy-constrained WSN/IoT scenario, including optional Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) effects and AES-variant security configurations.

## How to run
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Set the repository root as the current folder.
3. Run:
   - `main.m`

## Outputs
Simulation outputs (figures/results) will be generated during execution.

## Configuration
Key parameters can be configured in: main.c ,sim_INPUTS.m and neo_call_energy_info.m

## Requirements
- MATLAB (tested on: version 2024a)
